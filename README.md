Hello !
In this project, I performed a large scale analysis of over 2.6 million e-commerce transactions involving electronic products to extract actionable insights on customer behavior and optimize recommendation strategies. The workflow included advanced data preprocessing techniques such as missing value imputation, outlier detection, and categorical encoding. I applied unsupervised learning algorithms, specifically hierarchical clustering and K means, to segment users based on multidimensional features including average spend, product category frequency, and brand interaction. Furthermore, I implemented association rule mining using the Apriori algorithm to uncover high confidence and high lift itemset relationships, revealing brand affinity and cross category purchase tendencies. The analysis led to data driven recommendations including cluster personalized product bundles, affinity based cross sell offers, and targeted marketing strategies designed to increase customer retention and boost average order value.
